Introduction/Business problem
------------------------------------


San Francisco crime statistics report an overall upward trend in crime based on data from 17 years with violent crime increasing
and property crime increasing. Based on this trend, the crime rate in San Francisco for 2019 is expected to be higher than in 2016. 
This is as per report published at https://www.cityrating.com/crime-statistics/california/san-francisco.html.

The city violent crime rate for San Francisco in 2016 was higher than the national violent crime rate average by 78.95% 
and the city property crime rate in San Francisco was higher than the national property crime rate average by 122.03%.

In 2016 the city violent crime rate in San Francisco was higher than the violent crime rate in California by 59.55% 
and the city property crime rate in San Francisco was higher than the property crime rate in California by 113.13%.


San Francisco has several police districts with varied types of crime in each district. This Project will attempt to address
the trend in the top neighborhoods on crime categories so that the San Francisco police department can focus on the neighborhoods
that have the highest crime and focus on the top crime categories by creating task forces to address the crime.


DATA
-------
We are going to be using the public data available at :
https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783 
for the crime data of 2018 and also use Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in San Francisco. 
We will use the explore function to get the most common crime categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature
to group the neighborhoods into clusters. We will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. 
Finally, we will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in San Francisco and their clusters.
